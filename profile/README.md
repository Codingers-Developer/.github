   Technologies
In the campus environment, we apply and develop our knowledge in the C++ programming language. We understand the basics of programming with C++ and we are skilled in using concepts such as variables, control structures, functions, and data processing. Apart from that, we also explore our skills in the PythonPython programming language. We have an understanding and use of existing data structures, functions and modules.

In developing with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Next.js, we focus on developing responsive, interactive and easy-to-use web applications. We strive to use best practices in front-end development, including quality testing, efficient state setting and optimal performance. We love to expand our knowledge in this modern web technology and keep learning about the latest trends and tools relevant to front-end development.
